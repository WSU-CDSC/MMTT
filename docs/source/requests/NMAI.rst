## Requesting Metadata and Media from The National Anthropological Archives  

To request media files and/or corresponding metadata please follow these steps to connect with the NAA staff:  
1. Contact NAA staff via email at naa@si.edu.  
2. In your email be sure to include: 
   - The nature of the request (e.g., media and/or associated metadata).  
   - Brief description of your project (optional).   
   -  Tribal affiliation, if any.  
   - The spreadsheet indicating which specific collections and/or items you are requesting.  
3. A staff member will follow up by email with any questions, and likely acknowledge receipt of the request. They will then liaise with Smithsonian staff to fulfill your request.  
4. You will receive your requested materials via email, either as an attachment or containing a Dropbox link.  

*__Things to Keep in Mind:__ The return time for these requests varies and depends both on the nature of the request and the capacity of the repository at any given moment. This is particularly important to keep in mind if your project is time sensitive.*
