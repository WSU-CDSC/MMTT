## Requesting Metadata and Media from NMAI-Archives Center  

To request media files and/or corresponding metadata please follow these steps to connect with the Reference Archivist:  
1. Contact the NMAI Reference Archivist at the NMAI Archives Center via email at nmaiarchives@si.edu. As of September 2022, the Reference Archivist is Nathan Sowry. 
2. In your email be sure to include: 
   - The nature of the request (e.g., media and/or associated metadata). 
   - Make sure to specify whether you want TIFFs or JPGs.  
   - Brief description of your project (optional).  
   - Tribal affiliation, if any. 
   - The spreadsheet indicating which specific collections and/or items you are requesting. 
3. The Reference Archivist will follow up by email with any questions, and likely acknowledge receipt of the request. They will then liaise with Smithsonian staff to fulfill your request. 
4. You will receive your requested materials from the Reference Archivist via email, which will contain a Dropbox link for all media files and/or an attached Excel spreadsheet for all metadata. 

*__Things to Keep in Mind:__ For inquiries about object collections, the Reference Archivist will connect you with Kara Lewis, the Collections Information System Administrator/Analyst for NMAI. Although the requested media files and metadata will likely come from the Reference Archivist, Kara may be in touch with you directly as well.*
